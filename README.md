# Cpups_apps netdata plugin

Cpups_apps is a example plugin for [netdata](https://my-netdata.io) monitoring system.  
It collects statistics of the processor usages as a percentage for the selected applications.  
Realized on shell and intended for use with the netdata's [charts.d](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/General-Info---charts.d) module.

ATTENTION
> Because of the used mechanism for collection of statistics (through /proc filesystem) it is not possible
to obtain completely reliable data for cases when controlled process finishes the operation. For tasks where accurate
accounting of such scenarios is important it is necessary to use the pacct mechanism just as it's used by the [atop](https://www.atoptool.nl/) utility.

### Install

- [Install](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/Installation) netdata

- Copy cpupc_apps.conf to ${NETDATA_INSTALL_PREFIX}/etc/netdata/charts.d/cpupc_apps.conf
- Edit the configuration (cpupc_apps.conf) by specifying the needed application
- Restart netdata
